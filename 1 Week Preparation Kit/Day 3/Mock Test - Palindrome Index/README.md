# Palindrome Index
Given a string of lowercase letters in the range ascii[a-z], determine the index of a character that can be removed to make the string a palindrome. There may be more than one solution, but any will do. If the word is already a palindrome or there is no solution, return -1. Otherwise, return the index of a character to remove

## Example
s = "bcbc"
Either remove 'b' at index 0 or 'c' at index 3.
